# Notes and assumptions
- enter 1-4 strings
- count vowels
- return results in order
- assuming space separated strings (arguments used in implementation)
- return errors for too many arguments
- handle strings with no vowels (and consontants)
- only using english vowels or international?
- using Java after at least 3 years :D
- added main function to pom
